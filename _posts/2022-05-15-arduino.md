The purpose of this experiment was to design your own “Golden Arduino” which meets the same connectivity specs as of commercial Arduino, but has features for better noise control, assembly, test and bring up.

This project contains following implementations:

<!-- {:.gsd-table}
| Sr. No. | Features |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Feature 1 | Orientation detection and indication |
| Feature 2 | Low power operation | -->

1. Converting 5 V in to 3.3 V using LDO
2. Adding Atmega328 microcontroller
3. Adding CH340g USB to UART interfacing chip
4. Adding a 16 MHz crystal resonator for generating a clock and a 12 MHz resonator for the CH340g.
5. Adding appropriate decoupling capacitors close to the ICs
6. Adding a connector for the SPI and boot loading pins
7. Adding a TVS chip to protect the data pins from ESD
8. Adding power from the USB plug
9. Adding a reset switch with a debounce capacitor
10. Adding header sockets that match the location of the standard Arduino board so that shield can be plugged
11. Adding a ferrite filter on the AVCC pin to the ADC circuit on the 328
12. Adding 0.5 ohm series resistor in the power rail and connectors to measure the power supply current.
13. Adding provision to select the power supply either from a 5v external AC to DC converter or from a USB connector
14. Adding additional rows of ground pins adjacent to and spaced 300 mils center to center from digital io switching pins to reduce cross talk for I/O pin switching.
15. Adding continuous return plane for the golden Arduino
16. There would be test points for: oscillator, Reset pin, 3.3. V rail and 5 V rail
17. For Risk reduction digital circuit was isolated from the power conditioning unit
18. It was also noted that internal oscillator of Atmega328 can be used in case oscillator circuit does not work

## What it means to work:

### Power supply:

1. Check visually if LED for power is turned on
2. Measure the voltage of power rail on oscilloscope using 5V test point. Voltage should be around 5V.
3. Measure the voltage of power rail on oscilloscope using 3V3 test point. Voltage should be around 3.3V.

### Oscillators:

1. Around 16 MHz frequency available at Arduino’s oscillator
2. Around 12 MHz frequency available at CH340g chip’s oscillator

### Arduino Bootloader:

1. One should be able to flash bootloader into arduino board using Arduino IDE and commercial Arduino as ISP

### Programming the arduino:

1. One should be able to flash program into arduino board

### Switching noise comparison:

1. It is expected to have lower switching noise on Golden arduino compared to commercial Arduino.

## Schematic

1. Schematic was divided into functional sections: power conditioning, USB to UART circuit, Microcontroller and LEDs and switches
2. PowerTrace class was used to set 20 mils of power lines in layout
3. Appropriate isolation switches, LEDs and test points were used at required locations. This helped in risk reduction as these functionality act as debug pointers.

### Things done right

1. Every signal has a Net Label
2. Direction of power is appropriate i.e. 5v is at the top and ground is at the bottom.

### Things did not go the right way

1. Filter capacitor on chip CH340g for reset circuit should have been 22uF. This was a hard error. 22pF was replaced with 22uF.
2. This capacitor had 0402 package. It was challenging to solder 1206 part in place of these 0402 solder pads.

## Board layout

1. Appropriate design rules were set before starting the layout. E.g. via diameter, Thermal relief.
2. Name, board ID was used as board identification
3. Continuous ground plane was added at the bottom layer
4. Crossunders were kept below a length of ½ inch
5. Decoupling caps were placed close to the ICs

## Assembled board

1. Board was powered ON using 5v adapter or USB port
2. Board has a provision to be powered on either from USB port or from a DC jack
3. Board also has a provision of 2 custom switches (with debounce circuit) and 2 custom LEDs.

## What you actually measured to verify your board “worked”

In order to verify that board is working, following tests were considered.

1. Arduino is detected as CH340 under Ports

2. 5v and 3v3 LEDs were turned on

<p align="center">  <img src="/assets/img/arduino_worked_2.svg" style="width:70%; height: auto; max-width: 600px;object-fit:cover;"/> </p>

3. Bootloader was flashed successfully to golden Arduino. However, there was an issue where ICSP header pins of commercial Arduino did not work to burn bootloader into golden Arduino. SPI pins on the commercial arduino’s side header was used to resolve this issue.

4. Once bootloader was flashed, application code (blink.ino) was flashed into golden Arduino using Arduino IDE successfully.

## Measurements and Analysis

1. What was the quiet HIGH and quiet LOW noise on the die for the rising edge?

2. Thevenin source resistance of the 5 V power rail?

## Features of the board

Ground headers are placed 300 mils apart from signal headers
6,8 and 10 pin headers match with the commercial Arduino footprint

### This board was built to understand Good and Bad design practices of Golden and commercial arduino. Following things were done right during this process,

o Continuous return plane for Golden Arduino
o Decoupling capacitor in the close proximity of the IC
o 6 mil trace for signals and 20 mil trace for powerlines
o Isolation switches used to isolate the power supply and digital circuit.
o Labels for the test points, components and board ID (name and description) text would be included in future designs as well
o Test points at appropriate points to measure important signals.
