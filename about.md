· Project: Smart Spraying System
o Implemented live spraying tracker with the help of GNSS to assist customers to monitor their spraying operations in Vineyards/orchards. MATLAB generated C code was integrated into Android App. This reduced Proof-of-concept development time from 4.5 months (average) to 2 months.
· Project: Dashboard Digitization and Telematics
o Collaborated with cross-functional teams to develop a low-cost, feature-rich product to help farmers/ contractors receive alerts, status, and activities of their vehicles along with tracing and geofencing using an android app. JDLink: https://www.deere.co.in/en/tractors/
· Patent approved: US11363753B2 - Mower implement guidance system - Google Patents
Academic Projects
· CUBIT – solar panel and USB rechargeable, multi-mode smart measuring tape (Link)
o For this battery-operated device, power supply was designed. microcontroller+ BLE, LCD and sensors including magnetic encoder were interfaced using I2C, ABI, SPI and UART. Low energy mode software was written to enhance battery life. This device was configured to send measurements to android application over BLE.
· Work-life health assist using SiLabs EFR32 (Link)
o Configured Blue geckos in server and client mode. Server communicated with 9DoF to detect a bad posture for a specified time. This was then reset using the proximity sensor at the client’s end.
· Remotely programming AT89C51 (Link)
o Developed a module using ESP32 and MSP432 which can be connected to 8051 u-controller to program it wirelessly.
